This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for unit testing.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite includes:

- **Library/Utility Tests**: Type validation, prompt content, OpenAI embedding generation, ChromaDB client, RAG retrieval
- **Server Action Tests**: Message handling, RAG integration, OpenAI API interactions
- **Component Tests**: Chat UI rendering, user interactions, state management

Current coverage: ~88% overall code coverage across all modules.

### Writing Tests

Tests are co-located with the files they test using the `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension:

- `lib/*.test.ts` - Tests for library utilities
- `app/*.test.tsx` - Tests for React components and server actions

All external dependencies (OpenAI, ChromaDB) are mocked to ensure tests run independently without requiring API keys or external services.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
